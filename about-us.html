          <h2>The Beginning</h2>
          <p class="">
            Analyzen, a dream that started as a software development company in the University dormitories in 2008 by
            two young graduating students Sumit Saha and Ridwan Hafiz from BUET Computer Science & Engineering, has now
            turned into a successful Digital Agency, capable of full digital and creative support, catering to both
            local and international organizations. While Sumit Saha has been the Technology Expert of the Company since
            its inception to drive innovations and harness power of technology to solve real consumer problems, Ridwan
            Hafiz has always been the Creative Expert who envisioned the growing digital market of the country and
            wanted to explore this potential opportunity. The team benefitted from a Brand and Strategic Planning
            perspective, when Risalat Siddique a seasoned Brand Professional with multi-country experience joined as a
            co-investor for the company in 2014. The company was converted into a limited company in early 2015.
