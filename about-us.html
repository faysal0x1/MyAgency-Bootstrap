          <h2>The Beginning</h2>
          <p class="">
            Analyzen, a dream that started as a software development company in the University dormitories in 2008 by
            two young graduating students Sumit Saha and Ridwan Hafiz from BUET Computer Science & Engineering, has now
            turned into a successful Digital Agency, capable of full digital and creative support, catering to both
            local and international organizations. While Sumit Saha has been the Technology Expert of the Company since
            its inception to drive innovations and harness power of technology to solve real consumer problems, Ridwan
            Hafiz has always been the Creative Expert who envisioned the growing digital market of the country and
            wanted to explore this potential opportunity. The team benefitted from a Brand and Strategic Planning
            perspective, when Risalat Siddique a seasoned Brand Professional with multi-country experience joined as a
            co-investor for the company in 2014. The company was converted into a limited company in early 2015.

          <h2>#BestInTheWorld Culture</h2>
          <p>
            No fancy office, no cool interiors, Analyzen is always proud of only one thing: The people of Analyzen. It is a flat structured organization; each individual of team Analyzen, from Senior Planners to the Office Support staff, is known as an “Analyzer” and we do not have abbreviated long corporate titles, rather cool nicks according to their own choice. While senior Analyzers obviously lead relevant teams, there is no hierarchical positions or typical “boss” structure in the organization; it is a company of young Analyzers’ as much as the veteran’s. Analyzers feel that they are appreciated and allowed to take initiative to get things accomplished. Above all, they feel trusted. Hence, no one works for Analyzen; rather they work with Analyzen.

          <h2>Going Global</h2>
          <p>
            Growing on its success, Analyzen has been able to be the first ever Digital Media agency in Bangladesh to go global with the establishment of Analyzen Singapore Pte Ltd. in January 2016 and Analyzen Digital Myanmar Ltd. in Augusat 2017. While, it is common for other creative agencies to affiliate with other global agencies, Analyzen has set a new benchmark by creating its very own global hub operation in Singapore catering to clients in Singapore, Philippines, Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam along with Myanmar. This global presence introduced the company to a new partner Delwar Hossain, a veteran Finance professional who now leads the Media Buying & Ad Publishing activities of Analyzen.
